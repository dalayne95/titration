I wrote this program in python to solve simple titration problems where the molarity of the analyte is unkownn.

This was an attempt to learn Python by finding shortcuts for my homework. 

# How To Use It

To use this program, run the `titration.py`: 

```
$ python titration.py
enter molarity of titrant: .054
enter volume of titrant: 0.1
enter volume of analyte: .125
molarity analyte: 0.0432
```
